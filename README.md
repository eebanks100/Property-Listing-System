# Gui-DB-Development
This is a small C# program for a Property Listing System that allows users to be able to buy and sell properties.

This project revolved around:
* Security (hashing user information inside a database, prepared statements to reduce or eliminate SQL injection attacks, hidden characters when typing sensitive information in forms, etc)

* Proper use of the entity-control-boundary (ECB) architectural pattern for object-oriented software engineering.

* Developing a formal RAD (Requirements Analysis Document) documentation for a software project.
