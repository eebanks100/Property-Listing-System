# Gui-DB-Development
Property Listing System is a program that allows users to be able to buy and sell properties.

This project revolved around:
* Developing a formal RAD (Requirements Analysis Document) documentation for a software project.
* Security (hashing user information inside a database, prepared statements to reduce or eliminate SQL injection attacks, hidden characters when typing sensitive information in forms, etc)
